### Motive for Creation
Our main motive for this project was to address two possible problems:
1. Finding the average car price of a certain car brand and model at a dealership.
2. Identifying stolen cars. 


### Timeline 

How did we create this project in just three weeks? 

##### Week 1 (June 6-10)
During the first week of AI Camp we met with our groups and learned about the focus of the camp: computer vision. After we learned about computer vision and machine learning, we began searching for potential problems a computer vision project could solve.

##### Week 2 (June 13-17)
The second week of camp consisted of more machine learning based topics. Our team downloaded and uploaded images of Honda and Toyota car models to Roboflow using SERP-API and python and ultimately labelled the data in order for the AI to be able to produce accurate results.

##### Week 3 (June 20-24)
The last week of camp put all our skills together in a combined effort. We had a trained AI model and created a website using HTML and CSS to present our work. We used Bootstrap's templates and personalized our website in order for the user to be able to upload a car picture which is on the Detect page.

### The Website
##### Home Page
Our home page consists of a detailed explanation of our motives to create this project as well as a section illustrating the resources we used in this project. There is also a gallery of potential car images our AI can detect.
##### The Car Detector
The detect page is a user friendly way to try out our AI project. It has multiple features that allow a user to upload an image for the AI model to detect and produce an output. The confidence level is how accurate the AI model believes the image output is. Disclaimer: cars not Honda or Toyota will still be identified. 
##### Team Page
The team page is a brief summary of the team that worked on this project. Read about each member and what they like about programming and AI Camp!
